          I am incredibly passionate about all things tech! I have attended and
          graduated the DigitalCrafts Web Development Bootcamp to learn
          Full-Stack Web Development in order to jumpstart my career in tech,
          and it is the best decision I have ever made in my life. My love for
          coding continues to grow exponentially as I learn more and more about
          the intricacies and nuances of each language that I pursue!
