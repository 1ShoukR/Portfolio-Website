				<p>
					As a passionate and motivated professional, Iâ€™m constantly striving to
					improve my techniques, expand my skillset and find new opportunities
					to grow. Each of my projects - both solo and collaborative - have
					provided this growth and allowed me to establish myself within this
					competitive industry. Please enjoy my portfolio, and feel free to get
					in touch with any questions.

					<p>
						I have worked on teams and lead teams and managed a schedule 6 times
						a week of practice times, while also traveling and competing at
						tournaments, and handling immense amounts of pressure and staying
						focused on the tournament.

				<div>
					<p>
						I have consistently worked to stay on top of modern trends in
						technology and I am constantly working to expand my knowledge, not
						only in completing a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp but working
						on my own to build projects and learn new things.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						I have graduated from DigitalCrafts Full Stack Web Development
						bootcamp, and I am a passionate hard-working learner who can work
						independently and on a team effectively. I have a passion for
						frontend development using React, Typescript, HTML, CSS, frameworks,
						and vanilla Javascript, but am skillful in PostgreSQL, Node and
						other essentials for back end as well. I have built full-stack
						projects on my own and effectively as a member of a team. My
						education in technology is not only in the code itself but in the
						emerging trends allowing me to stay relevant and understand where
						technology is headed as a whole rather than the simple knowledge of
						syntax. I know my years in esports bring valuable skills to further
						round out the personality needed to be a software engineer.
